# Process 1: Demography

## 1. Demography

The primary purpose of the Demography Process is to provide estimates of the projected Social Security area population[^1] for each year of the 75-year projection period in the Trustees Report (TR). For the 2025 report, the projection period covers the years 2025 through 2099. The Demography Process receives input data mainly from other government agencies, and provides output data to the Economics, Beneficiaries, and Trust Fund Operations and Actuarial Status processes.

The Demography Process is composed of eight subprocesses: FERTILITY, MORTALITY, LPR (Lawful Permanent Resident) IMMIGRATION, HISTORICAL POPULATION, TEMPORARY OR UNLAWFULLY PRESENT IMMIGRATION, MARRIAGE, DIVORCE, and PROJECTED POPULATION. The following chart displays the key outputs of each subprocess:

| Subprocess | Key Outputs |
|---|---|
| FERTILITY | - Birth rates, by age of mother |
| MORTALITY | - Probabilities of death, by age and sex |
| LPR IMMIGRATION | - LPR immigrants, by age and sex |
| | - Legal emigrants, by age and sex |
| | - Adjustments of status from temporary or unlawfully present status to LPR status, by age and sex |
| HISTORICAL POPULATION | - Historical estimates of the Social Security area total population, by age, sex, and marital status |
| | - Historical estimates of the temporary or unlawfully present population, by age and sex |
| | - Historical estimates of the civilian noninstitutionalized population, by age, sex, and marital status |
| TEMPORARY OR UNLAWFULLY PRESENT IMMIGRATION | - Temporary or unlawfully present immigrants, by age and sex |
| | - Temporary or unlawfully present emigrants, by age and sex |
| | - Projected temporary or unlawfully present populations, by age, sex, and type (never-authorizeds, nonimmigrants, visa-overstayers) |
| | - Historical estimates of the temporary or unlawfully present population, by age, sex, and type |
| MARRIAGE | - Marriage rates, by age-of-husband crossed with age-of-wife |
| DIVORCE | - Divorce rates, by age-of-husband crossed with age-of-wife |
| PROJECTED POPULATION | - Projected total population, by age, sex, and marital status |
| | - Projected civilian noninstitutionalized population, by age, sex, and marital status |

[^1]: The Social Security area population is composed of: (1) residents of the 50 States and the District of Columbia (adjusted for net census undercount); (2) civilian residents of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands; (3) Federal civilian employees and persons in the U.S. Armed Forces abroad and their dependents; (4) non-citizens living abroad who are insured for Social Security benefits; and (5) all other U.S. citizens abroad.
