## 1. Introduction

The Office of the Chief Actuary (OCACT) has traditionally used hypothetical earnings patterns to illustrate a range of benefit levels, replacement rates, money's worth measures, and internal rates of return under the Social Security program.

### Scaled Workers vs. Steady Workers

| Type | Definition | Limitation |
|------|------------|------------|
| **Scaled workers** | Earnings at each age expressed as percent of AWI, based on actual insured worker data | - |
| **Steady workers** | Constant percentage of AWI each year throughout career | Over-represents earnings at younger/older ages, under-represents prime working ages |

### Career-Average Earnings Levels

The four scaled worker types have career-average earnings levels as percentages of the AWI:

| Worker Type | % of AWI | Career-Average Earnings (2024) |
|-------------|----------|-------------------------------|
| Very Low | 25% | $17,368 |
| Low | 45% | $31,263 |
| Medium | 100% | $69,472 |
| High | 160% | $111,156 |
| Maximum | OASDI max taxable | $163,970 |

**Career-average earnings**: Average of highest 35 years of earnings, indexed for growth in average wages to the year prior to benefit entitlement.

### AIME Distribution Comparison

**Table 1: Distribution of AIMEs of Actual Workers Retiring 2019-2024 vs. Hypothetical Workers Retiring 2024**

| Hypothetical Worker | % with AIME Less Than | % with AIME Closest To |
|---------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| | Men | Women | Total | Men | Women | Total |
| Very Low ($16,556) | 8.3 | 15.3 | 11.8 | 12.7 | 23.5 | 18.2 |
| Low ($29,800) | 17.1 | 31.6 | 24.4 | 16.9 | 29.4 | 23.2 |
| Medium ($66,223) | 44.2 | 70.2 | 57.4 | 30.3 | 30.2 | 30.3 |
| High ($105,957) | 73.0 | 90.7 | 81.9 | 26.4 | 13.5 | 19.9 |
| Maximum ($163,970) | 100.0 | 100.0 | 100.0 | 13.6 | 3.4 | 8.5 |

*Note: ~41% of all retiring workers have AIMEs closest to very low or low wage scaled workers.*

## 2. Developing Raw Scaled Factors from Earnings in the CWHS

### Process Overview

1. **Select workers** in CWHS for computing factors
2. **Tabulate earnings** for these workers
3. **Develop raw scaled factors** from tabulated earnings

### 2.a. Select Workers in the CWHS

**Continuous Work History Sample (CWHS)**: 1% sample of workers with some OASDI taxable earnings during their lifetime.

**Selection Criteria - Fully Insured Workers:**
- Total quarters of coverage (QCs) ≥ years after attainment of age 21 through 2021
- Minimum 6 QCs
- Workers with 40 QCs have permanent insured status

**Quarter of Coverage (QC)**: Basic unit for determining insured status. In 2025, requires $1,810 in covered earnings per QC (max 4 QCs per year). Amount indexed annually with AWI growth.

### 2.b. Tabulate Earnings

- CWHS contains taxable earnings 1951-2022 (2022 incomplete, not used)
- Analysis includes earnings for most recent 20 years (2002-2021) for ages 21+
- Earnings classified by age, expressed as ratio to AWI for that year
- Includes years with zero earnings
- Excludes years when worker was deceased or receiving SS benefits

### 2.c. Develop Raw Scaled Factors

**Formula**: Raw Scaled Factor = Sum of normalized earnings by age / Number of workers

**Table 2: Raw Scaled Worker Factors for the 2025 Trustees Report**

| Age | % with Earnings | Avg Earnings as % AWI (for those with earnings) | Factor |
|-----|-----------------|------------------------------------------------|--------|

## 3. Adjust Raw Scaled Factors to Match Selected Career-Average Earnings Levels

### Process Overview

1. **Calculate preliminary adjusted scaled factors** by overriding factors at ages 62-64
2. **Construct earnings pattern** and calculate career-average earnings using preliminary factors
3. **Calculate final scaled factors** to match selected AWI percentages (25%, 45%, 100%, 160%)

### 3.a. Preliminary Adjusted Scaled Factors

**Observed Pattern in Raw Factors:**

| Age | Raw Scaled Factor | Difference |
|-----|-------------------|------------|
| 55 | 0.869 | --- |
| 56 | 0.852 | -0.016 |
| 57 | 0.833 | -0.019 |
| 58 | 0.812 | -0.021 |
| 59 | 0.788 | -0.024 |
| 60 | 0.757 | -0.031 |
| 61 | 0.715 | -0.041 |
| 62 | 0.843 | +0.127 |
| 63 | 0.863 | +0.020 |
| 64 | 0.852 | -0.011 |

**Explanation**:
- Decline at ages 60-61: Some workers retire before claiming benefits at 62
- Increase at ages 62-63: Healthier, higher-wage workers with consistent employment are more likely to delay entitlement past age 62

**Adjustment Method**: Assume earnings for workers older than 61 stay constant in nominal dollars (decreasing relative to AWI).

**Table 3: Scaled Factor Adjustments for Ages After 61**

| Age | 61 | 62 | 63 | 64 |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Raw scaled factor | 0.715 | 0.843 | 0.863 | 0.852 |
| Ultimate AWI increase since age 61 | 1 | 1.0356 | (1.0356)² | (1.0356)³ |
| Preliminary adjusted scaled factor | 0.715 | 0.691 | 0.667 | 0.644 |

### 3.b. Construct Earnings Pattern for 1960-Born Preliminary Scaled Worker

**Reference Worker Profile:**
- Born January 2, 1960
- Earnings from age 21 through 64
- Retires at age 65 in 2025
- Indexing year for career-average earnings: 2024

**Career-Average Earnings Calculation:**
- Based on highest 35 years of indexed earnings
- Years 1981-1988 and 2024 excluded (not among highest 35)
- **Result**: $56,921 (wage indexed to 2024)

### 3.c. Calculate Final Scaled Factors

**Table 5: Key Ratios for Final Scaled Worker Calculations**

| Case | Selected Career-Average Earnings | 1960-Born Preliminary Worker | Ratio |
|------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|-------|
| Very Low | $17,368 | $56,921 | 0.305 |
| Low | $31,263 | $56,921 | 0.549 |
| Medium | $69,472 | $56,921 | 1.221 |
| High | $111,156 | $56,921 | 1.953 |

## 4. Developing Hypothetical Worker Earnings from Factors

### Method

Given a year of birth and earnings level, calculate annual earnings:

```
Annual Earnings = Scaled Factor × AWI for corresponding year
```

**Example**: Low earnings worker born 1970, age 22 earnings:
- Scaled factor for low worker at age 22: 0.154
- AWI in 1992 (when worker turns 22): $22,935.42
- Earnings = 0.154 × $22,935.42 = $3,532.06

*Note: Hypothetical workers are born in January, so a year of age corresponds to a calendar year.*
