  # Census Undercount Methodology
  # =========================================================================
  # Controls which undercount factors are applied to Census population estimates
  # to derive the Social Security area population.
  #
  # Options:
  # - "DA": Demographic Analysis (Census Bureau official, single-year-of-age)
  #         Shows ages 18-24 OVERCOUNTED by ~3-8% in 2020 Census
  #         More methodologically rigorous; uses birth/death records
  #
  # - "PES": Post-Enumeration Survey based factors (hardcoded below)
  #          Shows ages 18-29 UNDERCOUNTED by ~1-2%
  #          Better matches TR2025 population; excludes college dorms
  #
  # TR2025 appears to use factors closer to PES methodology, resulting in
  # higher population for ages 18-24 than Census DA would suggest.

  #
  # Note: PES found statistically significant undercounts for males 18-29 (2.25%)
  # and females 18-29 (0.98%). These differ from DA because PES excludes
