# ── EO_A: Authorized Temporary Employment-to-Population Ratios ───
# EO_A is further disaggregated by visa type. Each visa subcategory has
# a different employment-to-population ratio and OASDI coverage rate.
#
# Note: These ratios are SSA internal estimates. ARTEMIS approximates them
# from available data sources. This is a known methodology deviation (#5).
eo_a_ratios:
  # Visa subcategory employment rates (proportion of OP_A who are employed)
  # Based on available literature and ACS estimates

# ── EO_NA and EO_NO: Use civilian E/N ratio (Eqs 2.1.8, 2.1.9) ──
# No separate parameters needed — these use the same employment-to-
# population ratio as the civilian population of the same age and sex.

# ── Earnings Recording Status Splits (Eqs 2.1.11-2.1.14) ─────────
# For EO_NA (overstayed authorization):
eo_na_splits:
  mef_posting_rate: 0.40   # Fraction with properly posted earnings
  esf_posting_rate: 0.35   # Fraction with suspense file earnings
  # Underground = 1 - mef - esf = 0.25
  oasdi_coverage_of_mef: 0.95  # Fraction of MEF earnings that are covered

# For EO_NO (never authorized):
eo_no_splits:
  # Workers who began working 2001 or earlier
  pre_2002:
    mef_posting_rate: 0.50
    esf_posting_rate: 0.30
    oasdi_coverage_of_mef: 0.90
  # Workers who began working 2002 or later
  post_2001:

    esf_posting_rate: 0.40
    oasdi_coverage_of_mef: 0.80

# ── TEO Conversion Weights (Eqs 2.1.15-2.1.19) ──────────────────
# Ratio of at-any-time employment to average weekly employment.
# TEO_{component} = EO_{component} × conversion_weight
#
# Historical source: CPS data on duration of employment spells.
# For authorized temporary workers, weights account for partial
# presence in arrival/departure years.

  # By broad age group and sex
