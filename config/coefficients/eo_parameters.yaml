# METHODOLOGY DEVIATION #5
# =========================
# The TR2025 documentation specifies EO parameters using functional notation
# (EO_A(·), EO_MEF(·), TEO_MEF(·), etc.) without publishing the specific
# parameter values. These are SSA internal estimates derived from unpublished
# data on visa-specific employment patterns, IRS W-2 matching statistics,
# and internal MEF/ESF posting analyses. ARTEMIS approximates these parameters
# from publicly available data sources as documented below.
#
# The EO/TEO pipeline structure (Eqs 2.1.7-2.1.19) is fully specified in the
# documentation; only the parameter *values* within each equation are internal.

# EO_A: Authorized Temporary Employment-to-Population Ratios (Eq 2.1.7)
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# EO_A is disaggregated by visa type. Each visa subcategory has a different
# employment-to-population ratio and OASDI coverage rate.
#
# Employment rates reflect the fraction of visa holders in each category who
# are employed at any given time. These are approximated from:
#   - DHS OHSS nonimmigrant population estimates (FY2019-2024)
#     https://ohss.dhs.gov/topics/immigration/nonimmigrant/population-estimates
#   - USCIS H-1B Employer Data Hub and characteristics reports
#     https://www.uscis.gov/tools/reports-and-studies/h-1b-employer-data-hub
#   - BLS Foreign-Born Workers: Labor Force Characteristics (2024)
#     https://www.bls.gov/news.release/forbrn.nr0.htm
#     (Foreign-born employment-population ratio: 63.7% overall in 2024)
#
# OASDI coverage:
#   - IRC section 3121(b)(19) exempts F-1, J-1, M-1, and Q-1 nonresident
#     aliens from FICA taxes. H-1B, H-2A, H-2B, and L-1 holders are fully
#     subject to FICA regardless of residency status.
#     https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/foreign-student-liability-for-social-security-and-medicare-taxes
#
# MEF posting rates: For FICA-covered categories, MEF posting rate equals the
# employment rate (employer withholds and reports correctly). For exempt
# categories, earnings may still appear on W-2 forms but are not OASDI-taxable.

# Earnings Recording Status Splits (Eqs 2.1.11-2.1.14)
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# When OP workers earn wages, those earnings are posted to one of three
# destinations:
#   MEF  — Master Earnings File: properly matched SSN, correctly posted
#   ESF  — Earnings Suspense File: W-2 name/SSN mismatch, held in suspense
#   UND  — Underground economy: cash wages, no W-2 filed
#
# Background on MEF/ESF:
#   - SSA processes ~250M W-2 forms annually
#   - ~96% of wage items are posted to MEF after automated matching
#   - ~2-4% remain in ESF (name/SSN mismatch)
#   - ESF accumulated $2.15 trillion in wages and 405.4M items (1937-2022)

#
# The unauthorized population has much higher ESF rates than the general
# population because many use mismatched or fabricated SSNs for employment.
# The pre-2002 / post-2001 distinction for EO_NO reflects increased
# employer verification after 9/11 (E-Verify expansion), which pushed
# more unauthorized workers toward ESF or underground employment.

# workers more likely to have OASDI covered wages)"

# These individuals entered legally and may have valid SSNs from their
# authorized period, resulting in higher MEF posting rates than EO_NO.

#
# Pre/post-2002 distinction per TR2025 documentation (Section 2.1.c):
# After 2001, increased employer verification (E-Verify, Basic Pilot) made
# it harder for unauthorized workers to obtain MEF-posted earnings with
# valid SSNs. Workers who established employment before 2002 are more likely
# to have OASDI-covered wages in MEF.

# TEO Conversion Weights (Eqs 2.1.15-2.1.19)
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# Ratio of at-any-time employment to average weekly employment.
# TEO_{component} = EO_{component} x conversion_weight
#
# At-any-time employment counts everyone who worked at any point during the
# year, while average weekly employment counts who is working in a given week.
# The ratio > 1 because workers enter and exit employment throughout the year.
# Young workers have higher turnover (more job transitions) -> higher ratios.
#
# Source: TR2025 documentation Section 2.1.c defines the conversion weight as:
#   "total at-any-time employed / (military + CPS civilian employment)
#    for that age-sex group"

#   work experience: ratio of "worked at any time during year" to "usually

    "65+":   1.20    # Similar pattern to males
  # For authorized temporary workers (higher due to partial-year presence)
