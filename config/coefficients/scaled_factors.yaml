# Scaled factors express earnings at each age as a fraction of the Average
# Wage Index (AWI). Career-average earnings for each worker type are:
#   Very Low: 25% of AWI
#   Low:      45% of AWI
#   Medium:  100% of AWI
#   High:    160% of AWI
#
# Annual earnings = scaled_factor × AWI(year), where year = birth_year + age.
# Ages 62-64 use preliminary adjusted factors (declining from age 61 at the
# ultimate AWI growth rate of 3.56%) rather than raw CWHS factors, because
# raw factors at 62-64 are biased upward by healthier/higher-wage workers
# who delay claiming past 62.
#
# Used by construct_rradj() for RRADJ computation and available for
# other PIA-related calculations.
